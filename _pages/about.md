Welcome! My name is Muhammed Veli NAMLI, and I'm a passionate computer science student with a deep interest in the ever-evolving fields of cybersecurity, artificial intelligence (AI), and Web3.

This blog is my digital notebook and personal portfolio. Here, I share my course notes to help others navigate complex topics, along with original articles that explore new developments in technology. You'll also find links to my latest GitHub projects, showcasing my practical skills and ongoing learning journey.

Whether you're a fellow student, a tech enthusiast, or just curious about these subjects, I hope my content provides valuable insights and sparks new ideas.
